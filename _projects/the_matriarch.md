Writing has always been a passion of mine. I find it an expression of art, and there is no great pursuit in art than giving physical presence to a thought or emotion someone else knows as truth but has not yet found a way to manifest a reality for it.

I started writing The Matriarch in the spring of 2019, following two years of loss of my Grandmother. She was our family's Matriarch. A north star of love whom I admired greatly.

It's completion helped me cope with her loss, and finally come to terms with it. After completing it in 2020, I had sent the manuscript to some publishers to see if it was worthy of publishing. Turns out, it wasn't. ðŸ¤·

4 years later, I've committed to it's re-write. I've fictionalized the story to make it more of an engaging read, while keeping the purpose of the story the same, showcasing an appreciation for the wisdom of our past generations and the role we all play as catalyst's of love for others.

Rather than going through the hoops of attempting the traditional publishing route once again, I've decided to self-publish it through Amazon. This comes with risks, but from what I've learned from other authors, much of the marketing will fall on me anyway & the dawn of AI provides adequate editing resources and creative writing coaching.

The book is available for pre-order here. It's scheduled release is August 1st, 2024.
