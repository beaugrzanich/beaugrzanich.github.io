Writing has always been a passion of mine. I find it an expression of art, and there is no great pursuit in art than giving physical presence to a thought or emotion someone else knows as truth but has not yet found a way to manifest a reality for it.

I started writing The Matriarch in the spring of 2019, following two years of loss of my Grandmother. She was our family's Matriarch. A north star of love whom I admired greatly.

The first version was complete in 2020. It's completion helped me cope with her loss, and finally come to terms with it. I had sent the manuscript to some publishers to see if it was worthy of publishing. Turns out, it wasn't. ðŸ¤·

4 years later, I committed to it's re-write. I fictionalized the story to make it more of an engaging read, while keeping the purpose of the story the same, showcasing an appreciation for the wisdom of our past generations and the role we all play as catalyst's of love for others.

I published the story on July 1st of 2024. In it's first month published, it was a top newcomer on the Amazon Best Sellers list in Grandparenting, Biographical Literary Fiction, and Teen & Young Adult Multigenerational Family Fiction. As of May of 2025, 100+ people have gotten to read the story inspired by my grandmother and the love she had!
