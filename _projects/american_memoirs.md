American Memoirs more or less started in winter 2020, when I was 24 and waiting for the next train home from work in the Chicago suburb of Glen Ellyn. There was a delay in train schedule (typical) so I decided to take a walk around the town.

President Barrack Obama's newest memior titled "A Promised Land" was stamped across the windows of a book store I had passed. It looked interesting enough, so I dedided to give it a read.

The book ended up intoxicating for me. As a Chicagoland area resident for basically my whole life, I loved reading about his early years here and following along on his drives to springfield down I-55, now the "Barrack Obama Expressway", a rode I had taken many times on my way down to college.

The information around the election of 2008, the financial crisis, and topics I had understood in name-only as a passive passenger of history at the time was electric. I felt like I had a newfound look on the geopolitical events of my formative years, not written by mainstream media, but by someone who had actually made the history themselves.

When I finished Obama's memoirs, I knew I wanted more. So I did as any regular person would do, and decided to read all of the,.

It took me two years to get through this list: <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_autobiographies_by_presidents_of_the_United_States">List of autobiographies by presidents of the United States
</a>.

    The result. A large stack of sequentially older books, some falling apart, read one by one over the course of two years, and the accompanying podcast.

When I finished, I felt a strong desire to get my thoughts down before the bells of time rung them away, thus a podcast was born.

My first six episodes I made in 2023, mostly experimenting with the medium and seeing what worked and what did not. They can be listened to on any major podcasting platform. Here's a link if you like. <a href="https://rss.com/podcasts/americanmemoirs/">American Memoirs</a>.

In 2024, I added two more episodes, one with a guest I admired greatly, and one as a reflection on the election underway. I have no new episodes planned or underway.
