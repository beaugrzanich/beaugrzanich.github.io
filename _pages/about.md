I'm obsessed with living a full and meaningful life. Back in 2019, in a period of struggle I committed to living my life according to my 5 'whys' found above.

My 'whys' have guided my decision making for 5 years now. From writing books, to binge reading them, to [Hosting Podcasts](https://rss.com/podcasts/americanmemoirs/) or [Building Apps](https://www.astropaws.dog/), I find myself addicted to the mere essence of life, and the love of the human experience.

This website serves as a collection of my endeavours. Collaboration is welcome. Feedback is appreciated.
